# About football-app

This app shows latest football matches. User can see game highlights and goals from different leagues worldwide.

If user is using this app on desktop then he/she can choose a specific league on left sidebar and see games from that specific league.

On right sidebar there is a list of 10 oldest available football matches.

I used VueJS and Bootstrap for this app.

I also used this free API: https://www.scorebat.com/video-api/v1/

And you can visit app on this addres: https://latestfootball.netlify.app/
